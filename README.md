# Collatz_Conjecture
Collatz Conjecture: Ive Created a python program to get the sequence of numbers in a collatz conjectures. 

THIS PROGRAM GETS A VALID NUMERICAL INPUT AND GIVES YOU THE SEQUENCE OF COLLATZ NUMBERS

Collatz Conjecture:
       Collatz conjecture is been a unsolved problem in mathematics
for a long. If you take any natural number(excluding 0) if it's even
divide it by 2 (x = x/2) and if you got a odd number (x), multiply it by 3 and add 1
(x = (3*x) +1) and the conjecture is that almost for all numbers itll reach a sequence 
Loop 4-2-1 but people can't able to prove it. 

Ex: 
Input: 4
Output: 4 2 1
Input: 5
Output: 16 8 4 2 1
Input: 10
Output: 5 16 8 4 2 1
Input: 100
Output: 50 25 76 38 19 58 29 88 44 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
